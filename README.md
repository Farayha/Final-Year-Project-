To detect and mitigate fileless malware threats in Operational Technology (OT) systems using real-time memory forensics and network monitoring.

𝐂𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬:

🧠 Memory Forensics –

 o Detects 15+ advanced fileless attack patterns: PowerShell abuse, 
 base64 payloads, DLL injection, and more

🌐 Network Traffic Monitoring –

 o Implemented Suricata IDS with custom rules for detecting LOLBin 
 usage(rundll32, mshta) and suspicious traffic.

⚠️ Real-Time Alerts –

 o Real-time alerts via email (smtplib) and desktop popups (plyer)

📊 Dashboard & Reporting –

 o Built a Flask-based dashboard showing PID, process names, and 
 detection justifications.

🛠️𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤:

•Python backend with Flask dashboard

•Psutil for live process monitoring

•Regex-based command line analysis

•Suricata IDS with custom rules

•Real-time alerts (Email + Desktop)
